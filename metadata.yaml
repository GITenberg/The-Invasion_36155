description: One of the most acclaimed war novels of the twentieth century, William
  Le Queux's The Invasion is a thrilling work that imagines much of Europe falling
  prey to a German attack unleashed in 1910. Originally serialized in a British newspaper,
  the story was a smashing success. When published in book form, it sold out in stores
  around the world and ultimately was translated into nearly 30 languages.
